## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting sales for a Big Mart outlet using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the sales of different products at various outlets based on historical data. This model can assist in inventory management, strategic planning, and overall business decision-making.

The project encompasses several key stages, including data exploration and preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation. It leverages Python and common data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Data

The dataset used in this project typically includes the following features:

- **Item_Identifier:** Unique product ID
- **Item_Weight:** Weight of product
- **Item_Fat_Content:** Whether the product is low fat or regular
- **Item_Visibility:** Percentage of total display area allocated to the product
- **Item_Type:** Category of the product
- **Item_MRP:** Maximum Retail Price of the product
- **Outlet_Identifier:** Unique outlet ID
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year:** Year the outlet was established
- **Outlet_Size:** Size of the outlet
- **Outlet_Location_Type:** Type of city the outlet is located in
- **Outlet_Type:** Type of outlet (grocery store or supermarket)
- **Item_Outlet_Sales:** Sales of the product in the specific outlet.  This is the target variable.

> **Note:** Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory or specify the correct path in the notebook.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Aniket-desai-24/big-mart-sales-prediction.git
cd big-mart-sales-prediction
2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    -   Handle missing values (imputation).
    -   Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding).
    -   Scale numerical features (standardization, normalization).

3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    -   Create new features from existing ones to improve model performance (e.g., age of the outlet).

4.  **Model Training:**
    -   Split the data into training and testing sets.
    -   Train a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
    -   Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation.

5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    -   Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R-squared).

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:

-   **Handling Missing Values:** Impute missing values in `Item_Weight` using the mean or median.
-   **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Use one-hot encoding for `Item_Fat_Content`, `Item_Type`, `Outlet_Size`, `Outlet_Location_Type`, and `Outlet_Type`.
-   **Scaling Numerical Features:** Apply standardization or normalization to `Item_Weight` and `Item_MRP`.
